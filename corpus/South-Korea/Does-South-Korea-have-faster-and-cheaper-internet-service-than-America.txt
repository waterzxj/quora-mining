In general, yes. South Korea has faster and less expensive internet service. There are several reasons why. In no particular order:Competition - in my rural part of the USA, I have 2 choices. The speed is good, but would be considered “average” in South Korea, where consumers have more choices than most Americans. Many Americans have only one choice of ISPs.Population Density - compared to South Korea, the USA is huge, and outside of metropolitan areas, there is much more infrastructure just to get wiring to those areas. The cost of that is spread out among the users, so it is more expensive to connect the whole country.South Korea law requires that Internet Cables be available to anyone who wants to provide a signal to them. US law allows “closed systems”: your cable, you have a monopoly and can keep other ISPs out.Culture - High Speed Internet is highly desired / coveted in South Korea. It’s a status symbol to have the “fastest speeds”. Americans are generally satisfied as long as their streaming video and download speeds serve their needs.Government - South Korea, as a nation, decided 20+ years ago, to make sure that they had the best and fastest systems. US Government has had far less input into speeds here.My dad - he bought the lowest cost service, even though he could easily afford faster. His speed is painfully slow for me when I am helping him do stuff on the computer. Even though he streams more to his TVs than I do, he doesn’t mind the frequent pauses for buffering when he’s watching something (it drives me crazy). If you’re still reading this, you are probably imagining that I am a 20-something tech crazy millennial - I’m not. I’m a grandfather myself, but hate slow internet speeds and waiting!
