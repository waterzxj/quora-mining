North Korea, obviously.North Korea= Best Korea.Look at North Korea’s amazing infrastructure!With the colourful metropolis and capital that is Pyongyang……and its people!Power wastage? Pfft. Best Korea don’t have any of that.Also, North Korea has Great Leader Kim Jong Un, which no other country has!North Koreans are avid travellers and love to adventure! In fact, there are more than 200,000 North Koreans in China alone! They go through harsh terrains and battle various forces of nature to go to different places, that’s how much North Koreans love to explore!Unlike their unfortunate South Korean counterpart, North Korea is an independent country which is not controlled by evil Americans. North Korea is immensely grateful to Big Brother China, who provides them with money and helps them keep afloat their wonderful, Socialist Paradise!By Shubham Meshram, “Do you know north Koreans don't even waste food…two of three persons don't eat to prevent wastage”And lastly, all of us experience terrible traffic that tests every ounce of patience in our body atleast once in our lives. Not in North Korea! Most people can’t afford cars anyway. In fact, this is the busiest a North Korean road can get!In short, as you all might have already understood, South Korea is nothing in front of North Korea. North Korea is clearly superior. Aside from all the incredible reasons above, there are many, many more that put North Korea in a truly separate class of its own.[2/11/16] Update:Many people have asked if this answer is sarcastic or serious. If it isn’t already clear, it is sarcastic. As stated by many other answers on this thread, South Korea is a free country with a great economy and progressive government. South Korean people excel in various fields, from entertainment to science, and enjoy free movement both in and out of the country. The answer should really be obvious.

Many would say south Korea due to the fact that it is an medc or more economically developed country.They have far better power, water and food supplies. North Korea has little to no electricity in most areas, with the exception of it's capital city, Pyongyang. In Pyongyang, there are power cuts almost daily and frequently, sometimes for prolonged periods. In addition to this, water is often not up to the sanitary conditions of other countries. It is pumped up to homes in the morning and held in the bathtub.This is mainly due to the fact that after the separation of Korea into these two different nations, south Korea was taken over and economically funded by the United States, but north Korea was taken over by the soviets. The small amount of funding they get is from charities and this is spent on increasing their military and its development over food and actual help for their citizens and the country.However, if you are talking in terms of culture and spirit, I would personally have to say the north. I think this as all north Koreans have a strong pride in their country and have a sense of patriotism instilled in them from a young age. North Korea really does have some beautiful sights to see and for this reason I would highly recommend visiting or at least searching to see some of theses.Also, north Korea has totalitarian dictator leaders, leading to concentration camps and aggression, particularly in the case of religious discrimination for example, distributing bibles could land you in a re-education center. North Korea is also less free, having forbade citizens from leaving the country without permission or even moving around the country.So, the south is more developed, but the north also has some interesting qualities too. This is what lead me to the belief that is is south Korea that is the better of the two Koreans.
This question is very vague, so I'll try my best on answering it.In terms of purchasing power parity (according to the IMF as 2014 estimates and projected data), South Korea has a GDP per capita of US$35,379–29th worldwide and 5th highest in East Asia (which includes Southeast Asia) & the Pacific–, 20 times than their northern counterpart of a per capita GDP of an estimated amount of less than US$2,000, which would be about 20th lowest worldwide and with no doubt the lowest in East Asia & the Pacific.In terms of HDI score (according to the UN as 2015 estimates), the RO Korea ranks 16th worldwide and 4th in East Asia & the Pacific, with a score of 0.898 (categorized as very high human development), while the DPR Korea doesn't make the rank as not enough data was collected, but I'm able to assume it would fall into the category of low human development.In terms of military (2015 World Military Powers), South Korea is the 2nd strongest in East Asia & the Pacific–the 1st being PR China–and 7th worldwide. North Korea only ranks 36th worldwide and 11th in East Asia & the Pacific. They do have more active military personnels and reserves combined, but their equipment dates back to the Soviet era and is in great need to be updated. Both countries have strong allies too when it comes to battle. The North has PR China (and Russia), the South has the US and first-hand access to their high-tech updated equipment.I don't really know what you're really asking, but I hope my info helps ;)
it depends if you are fan of kim-un-jong and want to live an simple life with no electricity,internet or tv and earn money for food and survive then north korea is goodbut if you want to live in competitive and high tech society which leads to stress-full life then south korea is bad
